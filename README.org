#+title: Simple Game Boy emulator

* Build
** Requirements
*For the moment, the build process only supports Linux.*

The only requirement is just a standard compliant C compiler.

** How to build
To build this project, you need to compile the executable which will be used to 
build the rest of project.

#+begin_src shell
  cc -std=c11 -o yab yab.c
  ./yab
#+end_src

This executable also checks if there is any modifications to the sources files
to either rebuild itself or to rebuild the project.
